 IMPLEMENT CODE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES  
COPY PROPAGATION 
 
AIM: 
The aim is to implement code optimization techniques like Dead Code Elimination (DCE) and 
Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) to improve the efficiency and performance of a 
program. These techniques are applied to intermediate code (e.g., Three-Address Code or 
TAC) during the compilation process. 
ALGORITHM: 
 The desired header files are declared. 
 The two file pointers are initialized one for reading the C program from the file and one 
for writing the converted program with constant folding 
 The file is read and checked if there are any digits or operands present. 
 If there is, then the evaluations are to be computed in switch case and stored. 
 Copy the stored data to another file. 
 Print the copied data file.

t1 = a
t2 = b
t3 = t1
t4 = t2
t5 = t3 + t4
t6 = t3 + t4
x = t5
